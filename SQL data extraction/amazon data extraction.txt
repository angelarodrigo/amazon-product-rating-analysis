-- For this project, SQL was used to extract only needed rows and columns from amazon_cleaned data (in which data cleaning was done through Excel) for the preparation of analysis and visualization.

-- extract discount_percentage and rating for correlation analysis

-- extract actual_price and rating 
SELECT actual_price, rating

-- extract rating_count and rating 
SELECT rating_count, rating

-- calculate average rating and average rating count grouped by category and return the 10 top categories
